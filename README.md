# Football-Player-Segmentation-with-U2-net-using-PyTorch

UÂ²-Net or U2-Net or U-shaped Net is a U-Net like architecture. U2-Net is a two-level nested U-structure architecture that is designed for salient object detection (SOD). The architecture allows the network to go deeper, attain high resolution, without significantly increasing the memory and computation cost. This is achieved by a nested U-structure: on the bottom level, with a novel ReSidual U-block (RSU) module, which is able to extract intra-stage multi-scale features without degrading the feature map resolution; on the top level, there is a U-Net like structure, in which each stage is filled by a RSU block.

I uploaded 2 codes u can prefer whatever you want 

However I used dataset of football player, but Image segmentation, the process of partitioning an image into meaningful regions, has a wide array of real-world applications across various industries-

In medical imaging, it aids in identifying and measuring tissue volumes, locating tumors, and assisting in surgical planning. 

In autonomous driving, segmentation enables vehicles to distinguish between different objects on the road, such as pedestrians, other vehicles, and traffic signs, thereby enhancing safety and navigation. 


In the field of robotics, it facilitates object recognition and manipulation, allowing robots to interact more effectively with their environments. 

In the realm of augmented reality, segmentation is used to overlay virtual objects onto real-world scenes seamlessly. 

These diverse applications underscore the critical role of image segmentation in advancing technology and improving operational capabilities across sectors.

# Football-Player-Segmentation-with-U2-net-using-PyTorch

UÂ²-Net or U2-Net or U-shaped Net is a U-Net like architecture. U2-Net is a two-level nested U-structure architecture that is designed for salient object detection (SOD). The architecture allows the network to go deeper, attain high resolution, without significantly increasing the memory and computation cost. This is achieved by a nested U-structure: on the bottom level, with a novel ReSidual U-block (RSU) module, which is able to extract intra-stage multi-scale features without degrading the feature map resolution; on the top level, there is a U-Net like structure, in which each stage is filled by a RSU block.
